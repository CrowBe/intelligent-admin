## Timeline Estimation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 20-25 hours
- Priority 1 (Critical): 8-10 hours
- Priority 2 (Technical): 6-8 hours  
- Priority 3 (Process): 3-4 hours
- Priority 4 (Business): 2-3 hours
- Priority 5 (Cleanup): 2-3 hours

## Notes
- This plan assumes one person working systematically through the tasks
- Some tasks may reveal additional documentation needs during execution
- Regular validation against current codebase is essential
- Consider automated documentation generation tools where applicable
