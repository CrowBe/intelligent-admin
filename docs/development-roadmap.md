## Key Benefits of Simplified Approach

### Development Speed
- **50% faster to MVP**: 12 weeks instead of 20 weeks to production-ready
- **Reduced complexity**: Single codebase easier to debug and iterate
- **Faster feature development**: Direct integration without service boundaries

### Operational Benefits  
- **Lower infrastructure costs**: Single container deployment
- **Simplified monitoring**: One service to monitor instead of 6+
- **Easier debugging**: All logic in one place during development

### Scalability Path
- **Clear upgrade strategy**: Can migrate to microservices when needed
- **Database migration planned**: SQLite → PostgreSQL → distributed
- **Service extraction**: Can split services based on actual bottlenecks

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI model performance**: Start with proven models, iterate based on performance
- **Integration complexity**: Begin with well-documented APIs (Gmail)
- **Scalability concerns**: Design with scalability from the start
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and best practices

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to MVP principles
- **Technical debt**: Regular refactoring sessions
- **Integration delays**: Buffer time for external API issues
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Early performance testing
