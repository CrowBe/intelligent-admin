## Email Template

Hi Kinde Support Team,

I'm building an AI-powered administrative assistant application using Kinde for authentication and would like to request Gmail API integration through your Connected Apps feature.

### Our Use Case:
- **Application:** Intelligent Admin Assistant for trade businesses
- **Current Status:** Using Kinde for primary authentication (working great!)
- **Need:** Gmail API access for email intelligence features
- **Target Users:** Small trade business owners in Australia

### Why Gmail API Integration is Important:
1. **Email Intelligence:** Analyze and prioritize incoming emails
2. **Automated Responses:** Send emails on behalf of users
3. **Morning Digests:** Generate daily email summaries
4. **Centralized Management:** Want all OAuth through Kinde (not hybrid)

### Required Gmail API Scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly` (read emails)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send` (send emails)  
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose` (compose emails)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata` (email metadata)

### Technical Context:
- **Current Setup:** React frontend with Kinde React SDK
- **Architecture:** Planning to use Kinde Management API for M2M token access
- **Timeline:** Implementing Phase 1B of our development roadmap
- **Future Integrations:** Will need Slack, HubSpot, Outlook APIs later

### Questions:
1. Is Gmail API integration on your roadmap for Connected Apps?
2. What's the typical timeline for adding new OAuth providers?
3. Can you provide an ETA or priority level for this request?
4. Is there any way to expedite this for our project timeline?

### Alternative Solution:
If Gmail API isn't available soon, could we potentially use the Google Drive connection with additional Gmail scopes? Both use the same Google OAuth system.

Thank you for considering this request. Kinde has been excellent for our authentication needs, and having Gmail integration would make it the perfect complete solution for our use case.

Best regards,
