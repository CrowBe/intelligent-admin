# Scheduler Initialization Race Condition Fix

## Overview
This document explains the race condition that was fixed in the server initialization and how the tests validate the fix.

## Original Problem

### The Race Condition
The original issue was a **Temporal Dependency Error** where the health endpoint tried to access `scheduler.getStatus()` before the `scheduler` variable was properly initialized.

```javascript
// BROKEN CODE (before fix):
// Health endpoint defined before scheduler initialization
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'ok',
    services: {
      scheduler: scheduler.getStatus() // ❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'scheduler' before initialization
    }
  });
});

// Scheduler initialized AFTER the route definition
const scheduler = new SchedulerService(prisma);
```

### Error Message
```
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'scheduler' before initialization
    at /backend/src/index.ts:57:17
```

## The Fix

### Solution: Initialize Before Use
The fix was to initialize the scheduler **before** defining any routes that use it:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (current implementation):
// 1. Initialize scheduler FIRST
const scheduler = new SchedulerService(prisma);

// 2. THEN define routes that use it
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'ok',
    services: {
      scheduler: scheduler.getStatus() // ✅ Works correctly
    }
  });
});
```

## Test Coverage

### What the Tests Validate

1. **`server.test.ts`** - Comprehensive validation:
   - ✅ Scheduler exists when health endpoint executes
   - ✅ No ReferenceError exceptions thrown
   - ✅ Concurrent requests work without race conditions
   - ✅ Proper response structure with scheduler data
   - ✅ Immediate health checks after startup work correctly

2. **Race Condition Scenarios Tested:**
   - Multiple concurrent health check requests
   - Immediate requests after server startup (original failure case)
   - Rapid successive requests under load
   - Scheduler method availability validation

## Regression Prevention

### Key Test Cases that Prevent Regression

1. **Immediate Health Check Test:**
```javascript
it('should handle immediate health check after server start', async () => {
  // This exact scenario caused the original race condition
  const response = await request(app).get('/health').timeout(1000);
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.body.services.scheduler).toBeDefined();
});
```

2. **Scheduler Availability Test:**
```javascript
it('should initialize scheduler before defining health route', () => {
  expect(scheduler).toBeDefined();
  expect(scheduler.getStatus).toBeInstanceOf(Function);
  expect(() => scheduler.getStatus()).not.toThrow();
});
```

3. **Concurrent Access Test:**
```javascript
it('should handle rapid successive health checks without race conditions', async () => {
  const promises = Array.from({ length: 10 }, () => request(app).get('/health'));
  const responses = await Promise.allSettled(promises);
  // All should succeed without ReferenceError
});
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Health endpoint would crash on startup
- ❌ Application monitoring would fail
- ❌ Container health checks would fail
- ❌ Service discovery would mark service as unhealthy

### After Fix
- ✅ Reliable health endpoint functionality
- ✅ Proper service monitoring
- ✅ Container orchestration compatibility
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments possible

## Lessons Learned

1. **Initialization Order Matters**: Always initialize dependencies before defining routes that use them
2. **Test Race Conditions**: Include tests that simulate concurrent access patterns
3. **Health Endpoints are Critical**: These are often called immediately after startup
4. **Comprehensive Mocking**: Mock external dependencies to test initialization logic
