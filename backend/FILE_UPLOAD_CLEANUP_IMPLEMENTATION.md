# File Upload Cleanup System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of proactive file upload cleanup mechanisms to prevent disk space issues and security vulnerabilities from orphaned files in the AI-powered administrative assistant application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. FileUploadService (`backend/src/services/fileUpload.ts`)

#### Core Features
- **Automatic cleanup** of files older than configurable threshold (default: 24 hours)
- **Temporary file management** with separate temp and processed directories
- **File type validation** with security-focused whitelist
- **File size validation** with 10MB limit
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging
- **Statistics and monitoring** capabilities

#### Security Features
- Directory permissions set to 700 (owner access only)
- File type validation against allowed extensions
- File size limits enforced
- No executable permissions on uploaded files
- Secure file path handling

#### Public Interface
```typescript
interface FileUploadService {
  // Cleanup operations
  cleanupOldFiles(maxAgeHours?: number): Promise<number>;
  cleanupAllTemporaryFiles(): Promise<number>;
  
  // File management
  getUploadStats(): Promise<UploadStats>;
  validateFileType(filename: string): boolean;
  ensureUploadDirectories(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 2. Scheduler Integration

#### Automatic Cleanup Job
- **Frequency**: Every hour
- **Operation**: Removes files older than 24 hours
- **Directories**: Both temp and processed directories
- **Error Handling**: Continues operation even if individual files fail

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Schedule file cleanup every hour in SchedulerService
this.scheduleTask('file-cleanup', 60 * 60 * 1000, () => {
  this.cleanupOldFiles();
});
```

### 3. Server Shutdown Integration

#### Graceful Cleanup
- Automatically cleans up all temporary files during server shutdown
- Integrated into existing graceful shutdown process
- Timeout protection (5 seconds maximum)
- Comprehensive error logging

#### Implementation
- Cleanup executes before other shutdown operations
- Continues with shutdown even if file cleanup fails
- Logs cleanup results for monitoring

### 4. Admin API Endpoints (`backend/src/routes/admin.ts`)

#### Available Endpoints

**GET /api/v1/admin/files/stats**
- Returns comprehensive file system statistics
- Includes formatted file sizes and ages
- Shows allowed file types and size limits

**POST /api/v1/admin/files/cleanup**
- Manual cleanup with configurable parameters
- Cleanup types: 'old', 'temp', 'all'
- Customizable age threshold (1-168 hours)

**DELETE /api/v1/admin/files/emergency-cleanup**
- Emergency cleanup of all files
- Bypasses age restrictions
- Returns detailed cleanup statistics

**GET /api/v1/admin/system/health**
- System health check including file system status
- Integration with existing health endpoint
- Detailed error reporting

#### Security
- JWT authentication required
- Admin privilege checking (placeholder for role-based access)
- Input validation using Zod schemas
- Rate limiting applied

### 5. Health Monitoring Integration

#### Main Health Endpoint Enhancement
The main `/health` endpoint now includes file system monitoring:
- File system status (healthy/degraded)
- Upload statistics (file counts, sizes, ages)
- Error reporting for file system issues
- Graceful degradation on file system errors

### 6. Directory Structure

```
backend/uploads/
├── .gitkeep              # Maintains directory in git
├── temp/                 # Temporary uploaded files
└── processed/            # Processed/permanent files
```

#### Git Integration
- Upload directories ignored in git
- `.gitkeep` file maintains directory structure
- Proper .gitignore patterns for all upload types

### 7. Comprehensive Testing

#### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests** (`backend/src/__tests__/fileUpload.test.ts`): 25 tests
- **Integration Tests** (`backend/src/__tests__/admin.routes.test.ts`): Multiple endpoint tests
- **Error Scenarios**: Comprehensive error handling tests
- **Platform Compatibility**: Windows/Unix permission handling

#### Test Categories
- Directory creation and permissions
- File type validation
- Cleanup operations (old files, temp files, emergency)
- Statistics generation
- Error handling and recovery
- API endpoint functionality
- Security and authentication

### 8. Configuration and Environment

#### Test Environment Setup
- Environment variables configured in Vitest
- Isolated test directories
- Proper cleanup after tests
- Mock implementations for error scenarios

#### Production Considerations
- Environment-specific configuration
- Logging integration
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Performance optimization for large file sets

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Upload Cleanup
```typescript
// Manual cleanup of files older than 48 hours
const cleanedCount = await fileUploadService.cleanupOldFiles(48);

// Clean all temporary files
const tempCleaned = await fileUploadService.cleanupAllTemporaryFiles();

// Get current statistics
const stats = await fileUploadService.getUploadStats();
```

### Admin API Usage
```bash
# Get file statistics
GET /api/v1/admin/files/stats
Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Manual cleanup
POST /api/v1/admin/files/cleanup
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "maxAgeHours": 12,
  "cleanupType": "old"
}

# Emergency cleanup
DELETE /api/v1/admin/files/emergency-cleanup
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Log Messages
- File cleanup operations with counts
- Individual file removal with age information
- Error conditions with stack traces
- Performance metrics (cleanup duration)

### Health Checks
- File system status monitoring
- Automatic degradation detection
- Integration with load balancer health checks
- Detailed error information in responses

## Security Considerations

### File System Security
- Restricted directory permissions (700)
- File type validation against known safe types
- File size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- No executable permissions on uploaded files

### API Security
- JWT authentication required for all admin operations
- Input validation on all parameters
- Rate limiting on admin endpoints
- Audit logging for administrative actions

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Operations
- Batch file operations where possible
- Non-blocking async operations
- Graceful error handling to continue operations
- Memory-efficient file processing

### Scalability
- Configurable cleanup thresholds
- Background processing via scheduler
- Minimal impact on main application performance
- Support for large file directories

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor disk space usage
- Review cleanup logs for patterns
- Adjust cleanup thresholds based on usage
- Update file type whitelist as needed

### Troubleshooting
- Check health endpoints for file system status
- Review logs for cleanup failures
- Use admin endpoints for manual cleanup
- Monitor file growth patterns

This implementation provides a comprehensive, secure, and maintainable file upload cleanup system that prevents disk space issues while maintaining data integrity and system performance.
