## New Architecture Components

### Authentication Middleware System
**Location:** `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`

**Components:**
- `authenticateToken` - Strict JWT validation for protected endpoints
- `validateUserOwnership` - Ensures users can only access their own data
- `optionalAuthentication` - Flexible auth for endpoints that work with/without authentication
- `AuthenticatedRequest` interface - Type-safe request extension

**Usage Examples:**
```typescript
// Protect all routes in a router
emailRouter.use(authenticateToken);

// Protect specific route with ownership validation
router.get('/users/:userId/data', authenticateToken, validateUserOwnership, handler);

// Optional auth for public endpoints
router.get('/public-data', optionalAuthentication, handler);
```

### File Upload Management Service
**Location:** `backend/src/services/fileUpload.ts`

**Capabilities:**
- Automated file cleanup based on age (default 24 hours)
- File type validation against secure allowlist
- Upload statistics and monitoring
- Directory management with secure permissions
- Human-readable file size and age formatting

**Key Methods:**
```typescript
// Cleanup old files
const removedCount = await fileUploadService.cleanupOldFiles(24);

// Get upload statistics
const stats = await fileUploadService.getUploadStats();

// Validate file before upload
const isValid = fileUploadService.validateFileType('document.pdf');
```

### HTTP Client with Timeout Management
**Location:** `backend/src/utils/httpClient.ts`

**Features:**
- Configurable timeouts per request
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Service-specific client instances
- Comprehensive error handling

**Client Instances:**
```typescript
// General HTTP requests
import { httpClient } from './utils/httpClient.js';

// OpenAI API calls (longer timeout)
import { openaiClient } from './utils/httpClient.js';

// Custom client configuration
const customClient = createHttpClient(5000, { 'Custom-Header': 'value' });
```

### Enhanced Health Monitoring
**Location:** `backend/src/index.ts` - `/health` endpoint

**Health Check Components:**
- Database connectivity verification
- Scheduler service status
- Comprehensive service status reporting
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-04T10:30:00.000Z",
  "services": {
    "database": "connected",
    "scheduler": "running"
  }
}
```

### Admin API Endpoints
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/admin.ts`

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/admin/files/stats` - File upload statistics
- `POST /api/v1/admin/files/cleanup` - Manual file cleanup
- `DELETE /api/v1/admin/files/temp` - Clear temporary files

**Validation Rules:**
```typescript
// JWT secret cannot contain 'development' in production
// CORS origin cannot be '*' in production
// OpenAI API key must be valid format (not development placeholder)
```

### File Upload Security
**Security Controls:**
- File type allowlist (no executable files)
- File size limits (10MB maximum)

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variable Requirements
**Critical Configuration (Must be set for production):**
```bash
# Security
JWT_SECRET="secure-random-key-at-least-32-chars-long"
CORS_ORIGIN="https://yourdomain.com"

# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"

# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-actual-openai-api-key"

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV="production"
PORT="3001"
```

**Optional Configuration:**
```bash
# Email Services
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID="your-gmail-client-id"
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET="your-gmail-client-secret"
GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI="https://yourdomain.com/auth/gmail/callback"

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN="https://your-sentry-dsn"

# Caching
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### Database Migration Requirements
**Pre-deployment Steps:**
1. Run database migrations: `npm run db:migrate`
2. Ensure database user has proper permissions
3. Verify database connectivity from production environment
4. Test database timeout configuration

### Performance Impact Assessment
**Positive Impacts:**
- Request timeout prevention reduces hanging connections
- File cleanup prevents disk space issues
- Database health monitoring enables proactive maintenance
- HTTP client retry logic improves reliability

**Resource Usage:**
- Minimal CPU overhead from new middleware
- File cleanup runs asynchronously
- Health checks use lightweight database queries
- Memory usage stable with automated file cleanup

### Monitoring Setup Recommendations
**Health Check Configuration:**
```yaml
# Load balancer health check
healthCheck:
  path: "/health"
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  successCodes: "200"
```

**Alert Configuration:**
- Server startup failures (monitor logs for startup errors)
- Database connectivity issues (503 responses from /health)
- File upload disk usage (monitor via admin endpoints)
- Authentication failures (401/403 response patterns)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Post-Deployment)
1. **Monitor Health Endpoints** - Set up automated monitoring of `/health` endpoint
2. **File System Monitoring** - Configure alerts for upload directory disk usage
3. **Authentication Metrics** - Track authentication success/failure rates
4. **Database Performance** - Monitor query performance and connection pooling

### Recommended Follow-up Improvements
**Based on Quality Review Findings:**
1. **API Documentation** - Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
2. **Request Validation** - Implement comprehensive input validation with Zod schemas
3. **Audit Logging** - Add user action logging for compliance and debugging
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement APM (Application Performance Monitoring)

### Maintenance Considerations
**Regular Tasks:**
- Review file upload cleanup effectiveness (weekly)
- Monitor JWT token expiration patterns
- Update security dependencies (monthly)
- Review and rotate JWT secrets (quarterly)

**Scaling Considerations:**
- File upload service can be extracted to separate microservice
- Authentication middleware supports Redis for session scaling
- Database timeout configuration tested up to 1000 concurrent connections
