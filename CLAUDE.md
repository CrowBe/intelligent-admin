- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix where possible
- `npx eslint path/to/file.ts` - Check specific file

#### Component Organization Standards

**Co-located Component Structure** (shadcn-ui Compatible):
```
src/components/ui/
├── button/
│   ├── index.ts              # Re-exports: export { Button } from './Button'
│   ├── Button.tsx            # Component implementation
│   ├── Button.stories.tsx    # Storybook visual testing
│   └── Button.test.tsx       # Vitest unit tests
├── card/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── Card.tsx
│   ├── Card.stories.tsx
│   └── Card.test.tsx
```

**shadcn-ui Compatibility Maintained:**
- ✅ Import paths unchanged: `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`
- ✅ CLI commands work: `npx shadcn add button`
- ✅ Path aliases preserved: `@/components` → `src/components`
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compatible

**File Naming Conventions:**
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `ChatMessage.tsx`)
- **Stories**: `ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- **Tests**: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- **Re-exports**: `index.ts` (lowercase)

**Import Guidelines:**
```typescript
// ✅ Within component folder: relative imports
import { Button } from './Button';

// ✅ External components: path aliases
import { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

// ✅ External libraries: direct imports
import { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority';
```

**Component Development Workflow:**
1. **Create Component**: Implement in `ComponentName.tsx`
2. **Add Re-exports**: Update `index.ts` for clean imports
3. **Write Stories**: Create comprehensive Storybook stories
4. **Write Tests**: Add unit tests with good coverage
5. **Update UI Index**: Add to main `src/components/ui/index.ts`

**Testing Co-location Benefits:**
- Related files stay together during refactoring
